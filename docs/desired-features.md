# Desired Features

The following is a list of features we want to add now or in the near feature:

- [ ] Leverage small, distroless Docker image for even greater security and fast install
- [ ] Support deployment to secure OCI-compliant registries
- [ ] Use image digests instead of tags (greater determinism)
- [ ] Consolidate logging library usage and ensure good logging everywhere
- [ ] Add unit and integration testing
- [ ] Add context to returned error
- [ ] Add support for remote builder (e.g. AWS)?
